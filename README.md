# Aviart.xyz

Aviart is a platform that autogenerates avatars for content creators and streamers. With Aviart one can build their own unique avatar which is a digital identity that can be used to represent themselves accross across different platforms. 

# How it works

- A user imports an image of their face (any facial feature) where the main features get extracted. 
- From the extracted features we detect the main colors and shape e.g. the eye shape and color.
- We have predefined base layers that are used to match with shape and eyes extracted which we layer with all features.
- Layering creates personalized characters, and still gives the users the option to change styles.
- The avatar can then be downloaded and exported to different platforms.
